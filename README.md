# Learning Bioinformatics with Python :snake:
This my personal project I'm using to learn basics of software development (unit tests, version control), good scientific practice (reproducibility), and bioinformatics analysis (this bit will come later).

At the moment I'm using two books to do this:
* [Mastering Python for Bioinformatics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-python-for/9781098100872/) (O'Reilly, 2021, ISBN 9781098100889),
* and [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-data-skills/9781449367480/) (O'Reilly, 2015, ISBN 9781449367374).

So the project is me going through Mastering Python for Bioinformatics chapter by chapter and solving [Rosalind problems](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) while applying data skills I'm learning in Bioinformatics Data Skills.

Each directory of the project is dedicated to one Rosalind challenge.
