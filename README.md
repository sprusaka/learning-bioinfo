# Learning Bioinformatics with Python :snake:
This my personal project I'm using to learn basics of software development (unit tests, version control), good scientific practice (reproducibility), and bioinformatics analysis (this bit will come later).

At the moment I'm using two books to do this:
* [Mastering Python for Bioinformatics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-python-for/9781098100872/) (O'Reilly, 2021, ISBN 9781098100889),
* and [Bioinformatics Data Skills](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-data-skills/9781449367480/) (O'Reilly, 2015, ISBN 9781449367374).

So the project is me going through Mastering Python for Bioinformatics chapter by chapter and solving [Rosalind problems](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/) as taught while applying data skills I'm learning in Bioinformatics Data Skills.

Each directory of the project is dedicated to one Rosalind challenge.

Most of the code is very similar to example code in the book, but I am going through the examples line by line and adding my own flare to it.

## Helpful command line bits
Along the way I'm learning helpful command-line bits and bobs and list them here.

### Directories
* to make several directories at once`mkdir -p chap_04_fib/{data,output}`
* see contents of a directory `ls -l output/`
